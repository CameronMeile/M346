# Module purpose

The purpose of this module is to review the basics of cloud computing. It will cover the benefits of computing in the cloud and the reasons why companies have begun to switch from on-premises computing to cloud computing. It will also touch on the main services offered by cloud computing providers.

## Module description

In this module, you will take notes about the benefits of cloud computing and the services offered by cloud providers. We will discuss some of the impacts of cloud computing.


# Technology terminology

To learn more about the technology terminology used in this module, expand each of the following four categories.

- Cloud Computing
  - The on-demand delivery of compute power, databases, storage, applications, and other IT resources using the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - A platform that provides a wide range of cloud computing services.

- Cloud Storage
  - Saving data using a cloud service provider (CSP) instead of a physical machine.

- Server
  - A computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the Internet or a local network. In the cloud, a server is hosted by an outside provider, which is accessed over the internet.


# Background and misconceptions

### What is cloud computing?
Any time you are working or storing information online (for example, sending an email or watching a streaming video)—as opposed to on your local computer or on a server on your local network—you are using cloud computing.

### Why do businesses use cloud computing?
The business benefits of cloud computing include the following:
- Pay less to get your business started. Pay more as your business grows.
- Services are cheaper because costs are spread across many users.
- Your computing power and storage scales to fit what you need, so you only pay for what you use.
- It is faster and easier to add new resources when you need them.
- Cloud providers maintain, secure, and run the computers and facilities for cloud services.
- It is easy to release your application or advertise anywhere in the word because everything is online.

### What types of cloud services are there?

| Type of Cloud Service | What It Does | Examples |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) | Compute power, networking, and storage provided over the internet | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Rackspace, Google Compute Engine |
| Platform as a service (PaaS) | Tools provided over the internet for making programs and applications | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine |
| Software as a service (SaaS) | Applications and programs that are accessed and provided over the internet | Dropbox, Slack, Spotify, YouTube, Microsoft Office 365, Gmail |

### How did AWS get started?

- Origins began in 2002 when Amazon started the Amazon.com web service.
Offered tools for developers to work on the Amazon product catalog
- In 2003, Amazon realized that its infrastructure services could give them an advantage over the competition.
Provided hardware power, storage, and databases along with the software tools to control them
- In 2004, Amazon publicly announced that it was working on a cloud service.
- In 2006, Amazon launched AWS with just a few of the services that are still around today.
  - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
  - Amazon EC2 
  - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
- By 2009, AWS added more services
  - Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
  - Amazon CloudFront – a content delivery network (CDN)
- AWS has developed partnerships with several large companies. AWS has been growing and adding new services and tools ever since.
