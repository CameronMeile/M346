# Background and misconceptions

### What is cloud computing?
Any time you are working or storing information online (for example, sending an email or watching a streaming video)—as opposed to on your local computer or on a server on your local network—you are using cloud computing.

### Why do businesses use cloud computing?
The business benefits of cloud computing include the following:
- Pay less to get your business started. Pay more as your business grows.
- Services are cheaper because costs are spread across many users.
- Your computing power and storage scales to fit what you need, so you only pay for what you use.
- It is faster and easier to add new resources when you need them.
- Cloud providers maintain, secure, and run the computers and facilities for cloud services.
- It is easy to release your application or advertise anywhere in the word because everything is online.
